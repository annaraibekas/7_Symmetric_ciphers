"It's a validation for the service, which has invested heavily in prestige movies, at a moment when the streaming business is suddenly starting to look a little crowded -- including Golden Globe nominations on the TV side for The Morning Show, the new series from Apple TV+. The movie categories unveiled Monday will arguably help give additional shape to what's a rather unpredictable awards year, with only a few clear favorites and some top contenders hailing from Netflix, a service whose participation still makes parts of the movie industry queasy. Steven Spielberg, among others, has expressed skepticism about honoring movies that only view theaters as a pitstop on the way to home viewing. Although Netflix releases these movies theatrically, it's not clear how many people see them that way, since the service doesn't provide box-office figures. Last year, Netflix made a dent with the Spanish-language film Roma, with Bohemian Rhapsody and Green Book going on to win at the Globes, and the latter echoing that feat at the Oscars. That said, the Globes have always been in imperfect predictor of Oscar success, and not just because the presentation splits its top prize into drama and musical or comedy, while usually playing pretty loose with what meets the definition of the latter."
